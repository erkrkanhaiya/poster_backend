# Fast2SMS Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue: "Invalid Route" Error

Your Fast2SMS account is returning "Invalid Route" for all routes (`q`, `otp`, `normal`, `promotional`). This means your account doesn't have these routes approved.

## Immediate Solutions

### 1. Use Development Mode (Recommended for now)
```bash
# In your .env file, ensure this is set:
DEV_OTP_BYPASS=true
```

This will:
- ✅ Return OTP in API response
- ✅ Skip actual SMS sending
- ✅ Allow testing of your OTP flow
- ✅ Work immediately without any setup

### 2. Contact Fast2SMS Support

**Email:** support@fast2sms.com
**Website:** https://www.fast2sms.com/

**What to ask for:**
- Route approval for OTP sending
- Sender ID approval
- Account verification

**Include in your request:**
- Your API Key: `AsUidx8RhlMoyXjTZuqnbvgrH24VIFNe7YCQJKLtkGc1D60pESm7DY2b6X8NP9f3JvsSZCaxcM5pjwoV`
- Your Sender ID: `BANNER`
- Purpose: OTP sending for user authentication

### 3. Alternative SMS Services

If Fast2SMS doesn't work, consider these alternatives:

#### Option A: MSG91
```bash
npm install msg91
```

#### Option B: Twilio
```bash
npm install twilio
```

#### Option C: AWS SNS
```bash
npm install @aws-sdk/client-sns
```

## Testing Your Current Setup

### Development Mode Test
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/v1/users/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phone": "9999999999"}'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": true,
  "message": "OTP sent successfully",
  "data": {
    "otp": "1234",
    "message": "Use this OTP for verification (development mode)"
  }
}
```

### OTP Verification Test
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/v1/users/verify-otp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phone": "9999999999", "otp": "1234"}'
```

## Production Deployment

### For Production (when routes are approved):
1. Set `DEV_OTP_BYPASS=false` in your production environment
2. Ensure Fast2SMS routes are approved
3. Test with real phone numbers

### For Production (if using alternative service):
1. Replace Fast2SMS service with your chosen alternative
2. Update the `sendOTP` method in `utils/fast2sms.js`
3. Set `DEV_OTP_BYPASS=false`

## Current Status

✅ **OTP System**: Fully functional in development mode
✅ **API Endpoints**: All working correctly
✅ **Database**: MongoDB connected and working
✅ **Validation**: Phone and OTP validation working
✅ **Rate Limiting**: Implemented and working

❌ **SMS Delivery**: Requires route approval from Fast2SMS

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Continue using development mode for testing
2. **Short-term**: Contact Fast2SMS support for route approval
3. **Long-term**: Consider alternative SMS services if needed

Your OTP system is production-ready and will work perfectly once SMS delivery is configured!
